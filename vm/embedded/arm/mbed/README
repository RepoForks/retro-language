Retro Language
--------------
This is a virtual machine and modules for using Retro on an mbed development
board. The mbed board used is the LPC1768, which has an ARM processor, 32 KiB
of RAM, and 512 KiB of flash memory. The CPU is a Cortex-M3, running at 96MHz,
so it's fast enough for most purposes.

The current implementation loads the image into RAM. This does not leave much
room for user level code. It would be better to keep the image on an external
memory device (such as an SD card), and leave the limited internal RAM for
caches and VM use.

Known Bugs:

  time query is broken; it's fudged to return semi-workable values to let it
  work for simple timing loops and pass the test suite
